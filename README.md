# all_the_news_scrape


Ultimately the app failed to load on Heroko. I got it to install on the website, but could not figure out how to do so from my terminal.
I've included screanshots below.

Also, scraping is one of my least favorite things to do. I really struggled with this assignment and was really pressed for time. I hope to experiment with this more in the future though. It seems like it could be really useful.

The app did technically deploy, but the service could not connect. It get a 503 error, as you can see when you launch the app at https://nprscrapenews.herokuapp.com/
